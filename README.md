# gadgets

A repo to keep track of interesting gadgets and toys that I find or someone
tells me about. These are things that I might own already, desperately am
waiting to be released, or want in the future.

- [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering): Toys for audio. Great
    looking hardware design.
    - I got the [OP-Z](https://teenage.engineering/store/op-z/) and the 
      [PO-137 rick and morty](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-137/), as 
      well as the modules for the OP-Z: 
      [oplab](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z/modules/oplab)
      and
      [rumble](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z/modules/rumble)[^1].
    - I just ordered the [impossible I-1](https://teenage.engineering/designs/I-1)
      since it is back in stock.
- [Love Hulten](http://www.lovehulten.com/): Tech + wood crafting meet retro
    gaming. Interesting that in some instances it is just a raspberry pi inside
    and has other failings like mono audio.[^2] Perhaps not a problem with 
    more recent creations.
- [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/): Handheld device for
    playing old game cartridges. Awesome hardware design. However can only take
    cartridges, not ROMs. This is an explicit design decision.
- [play.date](https://play.date/): Handheld gaming device made by Panic! and
    Teenage Engineering. Amazing hardware design featuring a hand crank.
- [8bitdo](https://www.8bitdo.com/): Retro game controllers made wireless.
- [Polymega](https://www.polymega.com/): Swiss army knife of retro gaming
    consoles. Skeptical since it is not an FPGA, could also just be thier
    marketing doesn't show off their hardware like the Analogue marketing 
    does.
